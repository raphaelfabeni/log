Yeees! First log of 2019! I hope everyone had an amazing Christmas and I wish an awesome 2019! :)

Recently I've changed a little bit my blog trying to make it simpler. Again, I've done almost everything during my time waiting at the airports (as I always buy the cheapests ticket flights, the connection's duration are always long so, I have a distraction to waste time).

I've create two new pages: [thougths](http://www.raphaelfabeni.com.br/thoughts/) which I want to post some ideas that I tweet and [closet](http://www.raphaelfabeni.com.br/my-closet/) which I want/try to track some stuff that I read and listen. I'm trying to find something that does the same but for movies and series. If you know about something, please let me know! :)
