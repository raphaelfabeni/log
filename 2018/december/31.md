It's been a while and I'm really disappointed about didn't have time to write more. But I can't complain either. A lot of things happening, new professional challenges and this makes me excited every day to go to work.

These last days I'm struggling in finding a tool that could help me about making the documentation of our team better. Basically, I was thinking about something like a private blog that we could decide which posts we would open to the world or not. I was considering Medium but when I created a publication, only editors can see the unlisted (private) posts. The writers can only submit texts. :(

Any help?
