These last days (or weeks) I've seen a lot of people talking/complaining about life's quality. For me, this is an old subject. I've always talked about it, and sometimes I even had to listen some jokes about it. But it's fine. I'm just really happy that community and I hope, companies too, changed their opinion about it.
Keep moving!

A simple modal with fade effect using transition.

```css
.modal {
	background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.9);
	position: fixed;
	left: -99999px;
	top: -99999px;
	width: 0;
	height: 0;
	z-index: 999999;
	display: flex;
	align-items: center;
	overflow: hidden;
	opacity: 0;
	transition: opacity .3s ease;
}

.modal--is-active {
	opacity: 1;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	left: 0;
	top: 0;
}
```

For sure, there are a lot of other betters techniques, so please share them! :)
