It's already the second month of the year! The best month because it's my birthday! :) These last days were crazy! A lot of things to do! It's time for taking care of my back: physiotherapy and some time off the gym. Returning to web development: these days I talked with a friend about the _breakpoint_ craziness. There are so many devices with so different resolutions which it makes really hard to set a _mobile_ or _tablet_ breakpoint. We were talking about defining some default breakpoints or each component has its breakpoints. I prefer the second option.
