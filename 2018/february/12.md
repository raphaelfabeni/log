A lot of things to do: personal and professional lives. Keep going! Stay strong! And always want to be with people with good thoughts about the life!

I don't know how you guys like to use and test new features but I have to tell something for you. Some features of the JavaScript new version are amazing. One really simple that I can't live without it anymore is the short notation of arrow functions.

```js
const aloha = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const alohaDouble = aloha.map(function(item) {
  return item * 2
});

// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

const alohaDoubleNicer = aloha.map(item => item * 2);
// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
