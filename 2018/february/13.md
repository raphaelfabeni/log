February is being a crazy month! A lot of things to do plus Carnival and my birthday (the best day of the year). These days I was thinking about routine and how my life quality improved when I started working in a place without a fixed work time or a machine that registers the time you arrive and leaves. Of course, each side of this subject has its positive and negative points, but I think the word here is trust and responsibility. If you have these in the team, it's amazing!
