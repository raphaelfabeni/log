These last time I saw a lot of companies trying to hide their negative points using things like colorful architecture, video games, and even beer in some work days. If one of these (or all of them) is something you consider to accept a job offer, my opinion is you should spend some time thinking about others stuff life career opportunities, technologies, projects, and the list goes on.

A simple dumb React component using `classnames`.

```jsx
import classnames from 'classnames'

const Dumb = ( { condition } ) => {

	const dumbClasses = classnames({
		'simple-class': true,
		'simple-class--modificator': condition
	})

	return (
		<div className={dumbClasses}>Fabeni!</div>
	)
}

export default Dumb
```
