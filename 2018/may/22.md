On April I should posted more but it was a busy month with a lot nice stuff happening in my personal and professional life. This last weekend happened the [Front in Campinas](https://frontincampinas.com.br/) first edition. It was a great conference! Probably soon the org will share the talks.

Simple CSS animation for UI interactions.

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
	from { opacity: 0; }
	to { opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes fadeInFromTop {
	from {
		opacity: 0;
		transform: translateY(-50px);
	}

	to {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translateY(0);
	}
}
```
