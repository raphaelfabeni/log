Last week it was the time to return to meetups. I participated as a speaker showing a talk about [CSS tips](https://speakerdeck.com/raphaelfabeni/css-tips). It was really nice and I'm thinking in update the content to send the same subject to other meetups and conferences. Keep working!

Destructuring assignment is AMAZING!

```jsx
const Component = (props) => {
	const { name, quality } = props;

	return(
		<div>{ name } is { quality }</div>
	)
}
```

or 

```jsx
const Component = ({ name, quality }) => <div>{ name } is { quality }</div>
```
