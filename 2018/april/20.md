Welcome April! These last days the key word for me is job interview. How is hard always trying to making it better but at the same time is really cool trying to do it! There are news: [meetup CSS](https://twitter.com/meetupcss) is returning! **Yes!** I'm not anymore in the organization but I will always try to help when I can.

A simple `for` inside _Stylus_ adding a different delay for each child element of `.fabeni`.

```styl
.fabeni
	animation whatever 2s ease
	
	for num in (1..10)
		&:nth-child({num})
			animation-delay num * 0.1 s
```
