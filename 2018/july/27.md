Finishing the last details from my talk at Front in Sampa. Really excited about this. These last days I've been working more with [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) and I'm loving it. I won't lie that in the beginning, I felt kind of lost and sometimes it came to my mind that famous thinking: "What am I doing here?". But now, that I can understand most part of it, I would say that is awesome.
