March is being crazy but cool at the same time! The meetings' number is increasing, and despite I see a lot of people complain about meetings, I'm really excited about it because I'm having the opportunity to participate of big business decisions.

A simple Stylus `mixin` for `:hover` effect that I like to use in some thumb images.

```styl
$thumb-hover()
	display block
	position relative

	&:after
		position absolute
		left 0
		top 0
		width 100%
		height 100%
		background-color rgba(0, 0, 0, .2)
		content ''
		opacity 0
		transition opacity .3s ease
		pointer-events none

	&:hover:after,
	&:focus:after
		opacity .2

```
