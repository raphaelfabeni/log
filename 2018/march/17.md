It's been a while but that's ok! A lot of things to do and I will try posting more here. Even because I saw some tweets about this log and this is so exciting, that maybe I could help some people _logging_ this crazy stuff.

These last days I read about some life's quality. For me, it's all about balance. You need to find it and of course, it would be awesome if your job helps you with that. There are a lot of different opinions about this and I love to see the people's mind is changing.

Happy Women's day for you! Keep strong!
