It's awesome see a company (or a startup) grows. From only some employees to more than an entire floor. One important change I think, in the middle of all this growing process is having people who like to think in the _big picture_; always one step ahead and thinking in the team before herself/himself. I won't say it is easy, but it's being fantastic being part of it.

## :octocat: JS - React

If you use _react-redux-form_, you can easily set a validity for a model using this:

```js
dispatch(actions.setValidity(model, true));
//


const val = 'testing123';

dispatch(actions.setValidity('user.password', {
  required: val && val.length,
  correct: val === 'hunter2'
}));

// password field:
// {
//   valid: false,
//   validity: { required: true, correct: false },
//   errors: { required: false, correct: true }
// }
```
