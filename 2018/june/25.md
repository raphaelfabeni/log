These last days I faced a simple problem with a friend about `position: absolute`. If you have a `relative` parent with `padding` and a child element with `position: absolute`, and you want that the child element fills 100% of the parent width; it is better if instead of `padding` you use `margin` so the margin space could be calculated outside of the box. Basically, if you use padding, this space is applied to the parent element, so your child 100% width would be bigger than it should be.

```html
<div class="parent">
	<div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.parent {
	position: relative;
	padding: 10px;
	/* margin: 10px; */
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
}

.child {
	position: absolute;
	left: 0;
	top: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
}
```
