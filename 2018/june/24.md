This week there was the big announcement about Github and Microsoft. I read so much about this in tweets, facebook posts and etc that I gave up on writing about it. I just think Microsoft is mature and big enough to make Github even better.

Hey `flow-root`. Bye bye `clearfix`. I know you've already used... :smirk:

```css
/* Old and magic version */
.container-with-float-elements:after {
	content: '';
	display: table;
	clear: both;
}

/* New version to use soon */
.container-with-float-elements {
	display: flow-root;
}
```
