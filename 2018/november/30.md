I'm so embarrassed that I forgot this projects for a couple of weeks But here I am again. These last weeks had been a mess in Brazil due to the elections. I usually work on elections and I plan to write about it soon.

But let's talk about code: recently I faced a bug related with `position: fixed` and `transform`. Basically, I have a `parent` div with a `transform` property applied. Inside of it, there is a child div with `fixed` position. The problem is: when you apply `transform` to an element, it creates a new context and the fixed children elements start to behave as if they had `absolute` position.

Sad! Probably it's a bug between browsers. I got the bug in Google Chrome but in Internet Explorer, the behavior was the expected.

## :octocat:

```html
<div class="parent">
	<div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.parent {
	transform: translateY(100px);
}

.child {
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 50px;
}
```
