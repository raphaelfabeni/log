This last week was the first one after some days off. Who knows me, knows how much I'm a workaholic but at the same time the importance in my life of trying to have a healthy life. I think I can balance between these aspects and for me, the key is the organization of your routine. I'll try to write something about this.

On the professional side, I will share again the project I'm working on because I truly believe this could help and makes choice's people easier. So, if you need to renew or hire an auto insurance, here is the tip: [IQ auto](https://www.iq360.com.br/seguro-auto/ferramentas/simular-seguro-auto/?utm_source=iq360&utm_medium=internal-referral&utm_campaign=rfabeni).

If you are using [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) a nice tip it would be to use the `setDisplayName`. Doing this when you get an error you can easily find where it is.

```js
import compose from 'recompose/compose';
import setDisplayName from 'recompose/setDisplayName';
import lifecycle from 'recompose/lifecycle';

export default compose(
	setDisplayName('enhancers/YourEnhancerName/hooks.js'),
	lifecycle({
		componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
			// Yes!
		}
	})
)

```
