It's been a while! These last weeks I've been focusing on a lot of things that I didn't have time to update this project. But let's go! Trying to follow a new diet and I even wrote about this in a [post](http://www.raphaelfabeni.com.br/cuide-de-sua-saude/) (it's in Portuguese). On the professional side, I'm excited about a [project](http://bit.ly/seguro-auto-facil) that I've been working in the last few weeks. It's about car insurance and it's one more project from [IQ 360](http://iq360.com.br/). The idea here, basically, is helping people to find the best car insurance based on some questions. The project is still in progress and feedbacks are welcome.

This last week I faced something that probably most developers have already faced in their lives which is to apply a fixed position to a menu/div or something when it touches the top of the page. I was thinking the JavaScript logic I should start writing in the component but then, the CSS thought showed up. It was easier, faster and it helped to accomplish what I needed.


```css
.your-class {
	position: sticky;
}
```

That's it!
