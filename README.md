Inspired by my friend [Mendrone](https://twitter.com/vhmendrone), I created this `log` to document some thoughts and _maybe_ share some knowledge. The initial idea was something daily but I think it's better to call it just `log` and every time I could have some free time and good thoughts I will post here.
